# HoneyHive Logger

This repository contains language-specific loggers for HoneyHive that wrap our main `/events` endpoints.

All the SDKs have no external dependencies and are perfectly stateless.

This approach works better for serverless execution & super regulated environments with strict security requirements.

Supported languages: JavaScript / TypeScript, Python

Feel free to request a new language via a Github Issue.
